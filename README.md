# ATMs-Transaction_Mahmoud
This project for currency transfer and money transfer in the ATM was created by Mahmoud Alyosify
# The requirements:-
1. ATMs availability: Down times affect ATMs availability hence negatively impact customer
experience. In the light of the given data elements, can you support the ATM business with
insights on the machine’s availability during 2017?
For instance, were there specific ATMs that needed replacement/maintenance?
If any, are they still active or already replaced?
2. Down times are not only caused by fault in machines. Cash replenishment and regular
maintenance activities also cause the ATMs to be out of service for a while.
In the light of given data elements, can you propose a high-level schedule for Cash
replenishment or regular maintenance activities?
3. Bonus: In order to better cater for spar nord customer, we need to understand where to locate
our ATMs to ensure maximum coverage. In the light of given data elements, can you name top
10 locations used by our customers?
